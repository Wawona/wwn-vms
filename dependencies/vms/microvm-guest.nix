# wawona-microvm — a NixOS guest driven by microvm.nix under vfkit
# (Apple Virtualization.framework) on macOS. This is the p26 "NixOS VM" machine
# type's *developer path*: `nix run .#wawona-microvm` builds+boots the guest and
# `nix run .#wawona-vm-bridge` forwards its Wayland session into Wawona.
#
# WHY microvm.nix + vfkit instead of a hand-rolled rootfs:
#   * vfkit IS Virtualization.framework (same tech as the in-app Swift launcher
#     in ./WawonaLinuxVZ.swift), but maintained and driven declaratively by
#     microvm.nix.
#   * `writableStoreOverlay` + a virtiofs read-only share of the host /nix/store
#     means the rootfs is a tiny writable overlay disk — NO `make-disk-image`,
#     so NO nested QEMU/KVM VM is needed to build it (that is what stalled the
#     make-ext4-fs guest on the VZ Linux builder). The guest closure is realized
#     by the aarch64-linux builder and shared straight into the VM.
#   * vsock plumbing, Rosetta, virtiofs shares and NAT networking are all handled
#     by the microvm module.
#
# vsock topology (vfkit default "listen" mode == guest->host):
#   guest:  waypipe --vsock -s <port> server -- sway   (CID omitted => connect
#           out to host CID 2 on <port>; this is waypipe's documented guest->host
#           form, NOT `--socket vsock:2:<port>` which is a literal unix path)
#   vfkit:  --device virtio-vsock,port=<port>,socketURL=<unix sock> (listen):
#           when the guest connects to vsock <port>, vfkit connects to the host
#           unix socket, which the host bridge is LISTENING on.
#   host :  socat UNIX-LISTEN:<unix sock> -> waypipe client -> Wawona wayland-0
#
# NOTE: the vfkit runner hardcodes vsock port 1024, so `vsockPort` must stay 1024
# unless microvm.nix's runner gains a configurable port.
